# My eggnog recipe (interated over a synthesis of historic American recipes)

Ingredients for about 1-1.5 liters of nog (depending on booze)

- 6 yolks
- Optional: 1-2 whites, beaten to stiff peaks
- 100g sugar
- 2x vanilla beans
- About 0.75x nutmeg, grated fine
- 1x 250ml small pot double cream
- 750ml full-fat++ milk (6% is optimal)
- Optional, but delicious: 500ml Napoleon brandy, white rum, vodka, or similar. Don't go too oaky.

Destructions

- Whisk egg yolks and sugar together until creamed. Use a staff mixer to speed up the process. Once the color obviously changes and becomes whitish, proceed to next step.
- Add vanilla bean guts and the pods to the egg-sugar cream.
- Make a dense, very sweet custard: in a double-boiler (or a bowl suspended over a pan with a little water), over moderate heat, stir the egg-sugar-vanilla concoction constantly until a temperature of at least 60-65° C is achieved, not exceeding 85° C. Do not allow to cook on!
- Remove from heat, chill bottom of bowl in a bowl or pan of cold water, and continue stirring to rapidly bring the temperature of the custard down.
- In a BIG pan or bowl, dump in the milk and cream, then spatulate the custard in and stir until mixed.
- Sprinkle with a little nutmeg, taste, and repeat until desired megnitude achieved.
- If using raw milk, hell yeah brother. Up to if you if you want to now pasturize the lot of it: hold at 72°C for a couple minutes, then put the whole pan in the freezer and chill, stirring every 30-45 minutes until desired temperature is reached
- Optional: beat whites to stiff peaks, then fold through nog to add foamy fluffiness
- Add booze to taste. Also perfectly drinkable without alcohol!

Serves one, if I have anything to say about it.
